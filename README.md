## 🔥 Overview

Vidllux Engine is a **dual-purpose modification framework** for modern game development, inspired by Cfx.re (FiveM/RedM).  
It provides powerful tools for **single-player (SP) and multiplayer (MP)** game modifications, server management, and custom gameplay systems.

This repository contains the framework and server code for multiplayer game services, built to expand game functionality on an **end-to-end level**.  

---

## ⚙️ Projects Included

- **Vidllux SP/MP Framework** – Custom modification framework for PC games, enabling extended gameplay and server integration.  
- **Vidllux MP Server** – Server component for hosting multiplayer services and managing player interactions.  
- **Custom Networking Systems** – Uses embedded game networking frameworks and expands them for full engine integration.  

> Inspired by GTA/RAGE modifications, the framework **directly binds to base game systems** while providing custom extensions for gameplay and multiplayer features.

## ⚡ TL;DR

Vidllux Engine = 🔒 Proprietary + 🚀 Powerful Multiplayer Framework + 🎨 Fully Custom + 💡 Internal Studio Use Only
" width="32" height="32"> Cfx.re (FiveM/RedM) 

This repository contains the code for the Cfx.re projects, among which are the following:

* [FiveM](https://fivem.net/), a dual-purpose (SP/MP) modification framework for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V as released by Rockstar Games.
* [RedM](https://redm.gg/), a modification framework for the PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2 as released by Rockstar Games.
* FXServer, the server component for multiplayer services on the Cfx.re projects.

On the multiplayer aspect, the GTA/RAGE modifications differ from other similar modifications by utilizing the embedded game networking frameworks, building a modification framework around them, and expanding the game's functionality on an end-to-end level, directly binding to the RAGE Technology Group's base frameworks and Rockstar North's GTA codebase.

## Getting started
To play FiveM, simply download the launcher binaries from the [website](https://fivem.net).

To develop FiveM, please follow the documentation in [docs/](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/tree/master/docs) in the repository.
